          The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more
          productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break
          down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length,
          separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from
          the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer
          that Cirillo used as a university student.
